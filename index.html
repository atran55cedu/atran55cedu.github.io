            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>Hi, I'm Andy! I'm a transfer student from CPCC. Most of my time is spent on a computer so if you ever need anything, I'm usually able to respond quickly.</p>

            <p><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I moved to Charlotte back in 2013, and shortly after I was able to build the first of many PCs. A lot of my interests revolve around gaming and technology. Mainly getting technology to run games better. </p>

            <p><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I have an associates from CPCC, and aiming for a bachelors at UNC Charlotte with a focus in Cybersecurity. Primary Computer: I use my Windows desktop 70% of the time and the other 30% are split between linux virtual machines and my Macbook. Mainly working at my desk at home, and on the train to and from campus.</p>


            <h3 id="courses"><strong>Courses I'm Taking:</strong></h3>

            <p><strong>ITIS 3135</strong> - Front End Web Development: This is a course requirement, but in general it does help a lot with my next class being able to understand the skeleton of the web.</p>
            
            <p><strong>ITIS 3200</strong> - Intro to Info Security & Privacy: Required course, but interesting how it goes hand in hand with web development. The more I understand about web development, the easier it is to pick apart the data I'm looking at.</p>
            
            <p><strong>ITSC 3160</strong> - Database Design & Implementation: Required course, but very helpful to learn SQL.</p>
            
            <p><strong>MATH 1241</strong> - Calculus 1: Required course, always good to learn how to solve a puzzle. I'm extremely good at most games I play.</p> 
            
            <p>I'm at the top 0.35% in Aim Labs! Been playing league since 2011 as well. Very casual player regardless of what my ranks say. You can always hit me up if you want to play for fun! </p>
