        <p>Welcome to my personal page! I am a junior in my second semester at UNCC majoring in Computer Science with a focus in Cybersecurity.</p>
        <p>About Me!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal Background: I've moved to Charlotte in 2012 from a small town and have loved it since!</li>
            <li>Professional Background: I've worked in customer service and now warehouse logistics.</li>
            <li>Academic Background: I got my associates at CPCC before transferring to UNC Charlotte.</li>
            <li>Primary Work Computer & Location: Home on a Windows 11 desktop.</li>
            <li>Backup Work Computer & Location: Public transit on a Macbook.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Current Courses:</p>
        <ol>
                <li>ITIS 3135 - Front-End Web Application Development: This is a required course, but I always wanted to learn how to make websites.</li>
                <li>MAT 1241 - Calculus 1: Another required course, but I feel like understanding math concepts helps so much with programming. At least in terms of remembering variables.</li>
                <li>ITIS 4214 - Usable Security and Privacy: Yet another required course! It's very interesting to learn how most people think of security when you take what you've turned into habits for granted.</li>
            </ol>
