    alt="At the very top of the image there is the word TETRIS and it is huge and bold and screaming at you without actually making noise, which is impressive for letters. The letters are all blocky like they are made out of squares because Tetris does not believe in curves or smooth edges, it believes only in squares and suffering. The colors on the word go from red to orange to yellow to green-ish kind of, like a sunset but if the sunset was made in 1989 on an old computer that maybe had feelings but not enough RAM. Around the word is a red outline that looks like a weird box that goes down in the middle for no reason except it probably is supposed to look like the Tetris playfield but it kind of looks like a T wearing a belt or maybe pants."
