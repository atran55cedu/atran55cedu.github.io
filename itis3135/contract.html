            <p>I, Andy Tran, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2025, ITIS-3135, Front-End
                Web App Development class with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all work
                that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put
                information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. I also
                understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such,
                failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. I also understand that given the structure and
                content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code
                directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except
                where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
