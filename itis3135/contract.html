        <p>I, Andy Tran, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2025, ITIS-3135, Front-End
            Web App Development class with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all work
            that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put
            information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. I also
            understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such,
            failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. I also understand that given the structure and
            content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code
            directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except
            where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
            <br>

            <span>Signed: Andy Tran, 2/2/2026</span>
